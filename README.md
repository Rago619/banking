Objectives
    1. Mechanism of HTTP Web Server
    2. Handler Functions and Request Multiplexer (Router)
    3. Request and Response Headers
    4. Marshaling data structures to JSON and XML representations

Note : All ports are interfaces

Package gorilla/mux implements a request router and dispatcher for matching incoming requests to their respective handler.

Ports are constant. But adapters can be changed. Adapter is just a basis of conversion to what is specified in the port.

Go uses duck typing. A struct doesnâ€™t have to implement an interface in Go. Duck typing tends to happen at run time. If it looks like a duck, and it quacks like a duck, then it is a duck. If it has a set of methods that match an interface, then you can use it wherever that interface is needed without explicitly defining that your types implement that interface.
